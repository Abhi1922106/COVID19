# Model repository

Please put your models here. The best way is to add a new folder with
your model, including the `requeriments` if necessary.

## Best practices
* Fork this repository to add your contributions and add a pull
  request to update it.
* Develop your methods in Jupyter Notebooks if possible.
* Please provide a way to download your data in order to replicate the
  results as much as possible.
* All models should be placed inside the `models` folder.
* Create a new folder with your model, adding a `requeriments.txt` if
  necessary.
* Document your findings.
* Use graphical figures and explanatory analysis when possible.
* Use [issues](https://github.com/NIC-VICOROB/COVID19/issues)
    extensively.
* Sync the tasks between the members of the group with [this project template](https://github.com/NIC-VICOROB/COVID19/projects/1?add_cards_query=is%3Aopen).
